Here you can see the storymap with the top 15 attractions from tripadvisor.
All the attractions are stored in a database and loaded into the storymap.

	/* Scroll on attractions */

The style for the webpage is finished, but not implementet into the prototype yet.
We have a standard navigation bar on the bottom, after researching and looking for statistics on user friendliness
The bottom navigation bar gives around 30% less miss clicks because of the comfort zone on mobile.
We will use a hamburger meny on the desktop version.

	/* Move to Attractions */

On the attractions tab we have all the attractions stored in the database. It's also randomized,
so each time the attractions will be ordered randomly. We might order it by name later. 

	/* Clicking on  All | 3 days | 5 days */

By clicking on the 3 days or 5 days we will get a randomized trip suggestion of either 3 days or 5 days.
About page is 90% done, so we didn't implement that one yet.

	/* Move to account */

This is the login screen. We need to fix the visibility of the buttons here. When you log in,
you will be redirected to the storymap page again.
	
	/* Click on new user */

Here you can register a user, we have a full login/register system up and running.

	/* Move back to login  and login with pro1000 */
	/* Move to account */

This is the account page.
On the top we can see the username of the user
Then we have the list of different functions for the user

	/* Click on change password */

Here the user can change the password.

	/* Change password to pro2000 */
